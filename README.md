# hacker_rank_30-Days_of_Code_Challenges
	
	This repository is having the solutions for the HackerRank 30 days of coding challenge written in Python.




	I have made a conda environment for this challenge and have saved that in "30days.yml"

	For performing and running all these files its a better choice to activate this environment in which these have been written and executed.

	Follow these steps to activate this environment:
		"conda env create -f 30days.yml"
		"source activate 30days"

	Now you are in 30days environment and can easily run all the files in this repository
